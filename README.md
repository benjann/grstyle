# grstyle
Stata module to customize the overall look of graphs

`grstyle` allows you to customize the overall look of graphs from within a do-file without having to fiddle around with external scheme files. The advantage of grstyle over manually editing a scheme file is that everything needed to reproduce your graphs can be included in a single do-file. Furthermore, `grstyle` provides a number of useful features such as assigning color palettes or setting absolute sizes.
